## 🚀 About Me

I am a learner of the ALX <strong>[Backend Engineering Program]</strong> and I’m currently revamping my GitHub profile to stand out in a competitive job market.  

This is why I started with software engineering:  
> <em>Just like every great shinobi dreams of becoming the Hokage, I’ve always dreamed of mastering software engineering — especially backend development.</em>

<em>It hasn’t been easy. I've struggled, failed, and often felt like giving up. But each time I fall, I rise with more resolve.</em>

<em>Backend engineering challenges me in all the right ways: logic, structure, problem-solving. It’s the engine that powers the magic users see.</em>

<em>I chose this path not because it was easy, but because it builds the kind of thinker, leader, and builder I aspire to be.</em>

<em>This is my Hokage journey — and I’m still leveling up, one line of code at a time. 🔥👨🏾‍💻🍥</em>

What inspires me:  
> 🌱 Growth. 🌍 Impact. 🔥 Possibility.
